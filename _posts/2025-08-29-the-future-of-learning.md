# The Future of Learning

August 29, 2025

By Peter Romov

In an era where knowledge is expanding exponentially and traditional education systems struggle to keep pace, artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative solutions. The recent AI-Powered Education Meetup in London explored how machine learning, particularly Knowledge Tracing (KT), can revolutionise personalised learning.
Benjamin Bloomâ€™s seminal 1984 research, known as the 2 Sigma Problem, revealed that one-on-one tutoring improves student performance by two standard deviations compared to group learning. However, scaling human tutoring is impractical. Enter AI: by leveraging advanced models like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), we can replicate the benefits of personalised tutoring at scale.
