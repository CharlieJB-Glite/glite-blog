# Faster and Safer Testing for AI Tutors

May 5, 2025

By Vassili Philippov

Imagine building the perfect virtual teacher - a virtual tutor that knows how to teach any student.

But how do you test it? How do you compare teaching strategies A vs. B? Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, sure. But they're like waiting for a glacier to melt - accurate, but slow (think hundreds of students, months of data).

What if, instead of real students, we had virtual ones?

Think of it like this: How do they train self-driving cars? They don't just unleash them on the highway. They use incredibly detailed simulators—millions of miles driven, countless scenarios—before a single car hits the road.

A virtual student is the same idea. It's a model that learns like a student.

"Wait, a what?" you may say. "Are we talking about sentient AI here? Is this even possible?"

Let's break it down. Forget the sci-fi for a second.

## What a Virtual Student Actually Does

At its core, a virtual student does one simple thing:

Predicts how a student will perform on the next learning task, based on their past learning history.

That's it.

- Input: Learning history: (activity 1, response 1, time 1), (activity 2, response 2, time 2)...
- Output: Predicted response to activity 3.

## Beyond Right/Wrong: Rich Signals

And it's not just about questions and answers. Think broader:

- Activities: Could be anything—reading a passage, solving a problem, watching a video, playing an educational game.
- Responses: Not just "right" or "wrong." It's the whole picture:
  - Did they get it correct?
  - How long did it take them? (Response time is a huge clue.)
  - Did they give up? (That tells you something even if they didn't answer.)
  - When did they study? (Timing matters.)

If you can model that, you can test any teaching strategy. You can run thousands of "virtual experiments" in hours, not years.

## This Isn’t Fantasy: It’s Knowledge Tracing (KT)

This approach has a name: Knowledge Tracing (KT).

KT models track a student's knowledge state—like a GPS for learning.

Sounds complex? It is. Predicting human behavior is hard. But in specific areas, it's already working.

Example: learning vocabulary. KT-powered algorithms can beat traditional spaced repetition. They choose the optimal word to review now, based on your entire history. It’s like having a personal tutor who knows your brain.

Think about this:

- Traditional spaced repetition: show word after 1 day, 3 days, 7 days...
- KT-powered spaced repetition: choose the optimal word based on your full learning history and a simulation of possible futures.

The difference? It’s like a doctor prescribing a fixed dose vs. adjusting the dose based on your blood tests—personalized vs. one-size-fits-all.

We’re not talking about replacing teachers. We’re talking about giving them superpowers. We’re talking about moving education from intuition to data.
